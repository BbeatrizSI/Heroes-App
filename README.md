# [Heroes App!](https://bbeatrizsi.github.io/Heroes-App/)

> This project was created with [React](https://es.reactjs.org/), and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.

## What can you find out?

This is a simple Heroes directory in which you can filter by publisher or search by name.

## Where's the fun in this?

First of all, I have simulated a login and have protected routes the way that if you aren't logged you can't access to the main information (indeed, if you know the route, you can type it in browser, but you will be redirected to Login screen).

I have used hooks and custom hooks like: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useContext` or `useForm`.

Also, I have used "LocalStorage" in case you have to stop looking for heroes for lunch and keep learning about superpowers later.
